      <h1>Language Profile</h1>
      <p>
        I am a multilingual professional who primarily works in English for technical and research activities,
        and in Japanese for day-to-day communication in Japan. My language use is domain-based rather than tied
        to nationality, and I switch languages flexibly depending on context and the people around me.
      </p>

      <p>
        My strengths are in <strong>audio-based comprehension</strong> and
        <strong>context-driven understanding</strong>. I process language mainly through sound and semantic
        context, which allows me to understand spoken Japanese and English effectively during real communication.
        In technical settings, English is my most natural working language, while Japanese remains my primary
        language for verbal interaction at work.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the same time, I have some <strong>orthographic limitations in Japanese</strong>, especially with
        kanji in isolation, multiple readings of characters, and writing by hand. These weaknesses appear mainly
        in test-style or form-based situations, but they do not affect my practical ability to communicate or
        understand Japanese in real environments. My reading comprehension works best with context, rather than
        character-level recall.
      </p>

      <p>
        I regularly interact with colleagues and friends from diverse linguistic backgrounds, including many
        L1 Chinese speakers. In these situations, I often use a mixture of Japanese and English to ensure mutual
        understanding. This adaptive code-switching is a natural part of how I communicate in multilingual
        settings.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also occasionally experience listening difficulty when conversations involve rapid code-switching,
        unclear articulation, or multiple accents. This is related to cognitive load rather than lack of
        proficiency, and it does not affect normal communication when context is clear.
      </p>

      <p>Overall, my language profile can be summarized as:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>English</strong>: Primary language for technical thought, writing, and research
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Japanese</strong>: Primary spoken language for workplace communication; strong in context,
          weaker in orthography
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Multilingual Adaptation</strong>: Frequent code-switching with international colleagues
          (especially Chinese L1 speakers)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Strengths</strong>: Audio-dominant processing, context-based comprehension,
          flexible multilingual communication
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Weaknesses</strong>: Limited kanji recall/writing; reduced listening accuracy
          under high cognitive load
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This profile reflects how I naturally communicate across languages and helps explain the domains where
        each language is most effective for me.
